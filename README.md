Gradient descent using Python

Simple Python demonstration of deriving PCA, Autoencoder, and Factorization. Also shows how they result in similar matrices when reduced to the same dimnensions.

Section 1:
Derives the first 10 principal components

Section 2:
Encodes the design matrix into 10 features using gradient descent and the autoencoder framework


Section 3:
Factorizes the design matrix into 10 features using gradient descent
