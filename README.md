Gradient descent using Python

Demonstration of deriving PCA, Autoencoder, and Factorization, and how they all arrive at similar matrices. 

Section 1:
Derives the first 10 principal components

Section 2:
Encodes the design matrix into 10 features using gradient descent and the autoencoder framework
Compares #1 to #2 using a distance measure

Section 3:
Factorizes the design matrix into 10 features using gradient descent
Compares all 3 using a distance measure
